# CODING_STANDARDS.md

## 1. Naming Conventions
Use English names for all code, files, and identifiers. Use clear, descriptive terms and avoid abbreviations that are not standard. Use PascalCase for types and classes, camelCase for variables and functions, and snake_case for PostgreSQL database objects.

## 2. Project Structure
Organize code by domain or responsibility rather than by technical layer alone. Keep related logic together and separate concerns that differ in purpose. Maintain a consistent folder structure across modules and preserve existing repository boundaries.

## 3. General Coding Rules
Write code that is explicit, readable, and easy to review. Prefer small, focused units over large abstractions. Avoid duplicated logic. Avoid magic values and unexplained shortcuts. Keep behavior predictable and make intent clear in the code.

**Boring Engineering Wins (permanent principle, evidence-institutionalized 2026-07-17).** When two solutions produce the same verified outcome, choose the boring one — simpler, more predictable, more maintainable — over the clever one. Clever is what a future engineer (human or AI) has to decode at 3am. Evidence for this repo, not assertion: session-of-record showed clever first drafts (a lateral-join count expression; a direct-wrap view over a tenant-raising function) each *replaced* by the boring equivalent (`get diagnostics row_count`; lateral-gated view) with identical behavior and far less to misread. This is `AGENTS.md §3` Earn-It applied at code altitude; it is the *default*, invoked without ceremony.

**Two related proposals evaluated 2026-07-17 and REJECTED as new principles — already owned, more strongly, elsewhere (recorded so they are not re-litigated, per `GOVERNANCE.md §19`):** (1) *Strict TDD (test-first).* Rejected: for SQL migrations a pgTAP/behavioral assertion cannot meaningfully precede the schema it inspects, and the genuine value (regression safety + design pressure) is already delivered by **Test-before-trust** (`AGENTS.md §2`) + the **discovery-to-guard loop** (`GOVERNANCE.md §18`) — every non-trivial change already ships an executable check (self-gating smoke, behavioral test, pgTAP invariant) run on every `db reset` and in CI. The standard is *test-verified*, not *test-first*. (2) *"Every new capability should eventually eliminate unnecessary complexity."* Rejected as a weaker, unbounded restatement of the **Anti-entropy / boy-scout invariant** (`AGENTS.md §2`: every session leaves the repo at least as clean and reduces entropy where the work touches) + **Retention Earn-It** (`GOVERNANCE.md §18`). The existing wording is measurable (the guard must stay CLEAN; no new duplicate authority); "eventually" is not.

## 4. SQL Standards

Use PostgreSQL-compatible SQL and keep statements clear and deterministic. Prefer explicit constraints, sensible defaults, and consistent naming. Avoid implicit behavior and ensure schema changes preserve data integrity. Keep queries readable and maintainable.

### PostgreSQL Requirements

- Primary keys: UUID on every table
- Timestamps: TIMESTAMPTZ for all timestamp columns
- Money: NUMERIC for all monetary values
- Naming: snake_case for all database objects
- Queries: No SELECT *
- Foreign keys: explicit constraint names on every FK
- Indexes: explicit names on every index
- Constraints: CHECK constraints where appropriate
- Documentation: comments on all tables and all columns

## 5. API Standards
Design APIs to be consistent, predictable, and explicit. Use clear request and response shapes, stable naming, and consistent error behavior. Avoid unnecessary parameters and ensure the contract is understandable without hidden assumptions.

## 6. Error Handling
Handle errors explicitly and fail in a controlled way. Preserve useful context for diagnosis without exposing sensitive information. Avoid silent failures and ensure abnormal conditions are surfaced in a consistent manner.

## 7. Logging
Use logging to support diagnosis and operational awareness. Log meaningful events, include sufficient context, and avoid excessive or redundant output. Keep logging consistent across the codebase and avoid logging sensitive data.

## 8. Security
Protect secrets, credentials, and sensitive data at all times. Validate input, enforce authorization boundaries, and avoid unsafe assumptions. Follow least-privilege principles and preserve trust boundaries in every change.

## 9. Performance
Write code that is efficient enough for the intended workload without unnecessary complexity. Favor clear implementation over premature optimization. Use indexes and query structure decisions only when they are justified by measurable need.

## 10. Code Review Checklist
Review every change for correctness, clarity, maintainability, security, and consistency with these standards. Confirm that the change is necessary, scoped correctly, and does not introduce ambiguity or unnecessary risk. Verify that the change does not conflict with the canonical documentation.

## 11. Canonical Architecture

All implementation must remain consistent with the canonical architecture.

Never bypass or contradict canonical design decisions without explicit approval.
