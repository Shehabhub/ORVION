# ORVION MASTER RISK REGISTER

Status: **Permanent cumulative risk register.** Never recreate; evolve. Risk = the production/compliance/architectural consequence if a finding is NOT addressed before its trigger. Cross-reference: `MASTER_GAP_REGISTER.md`.

Last updated: 2026-07-11. Likelihood × Impact → Risk. Trigger = the event after which the risk becomes materially harder/impossible to mitigate.
