# ORVION MASTER CERTIFICATION STATUS

Status: **Permanent cumulative certification ledger.** Never recreate; evolve. Records what is certified, conditionally certified, or not certified, and the exact conditions to reach unconditional certification. Cross-reference: `MASTER_GAP_REGISTER.md`, `MASTER_DESIGN_CHECKLIST.md`.

Last updated: 2026-07-18 (Post-production synchronization — production database deployment verified by matching local/remote migrations through `202607049600`; repository health counts refreshed; Phase 9 Tier A and the Phase 8 ORVION-side pipeline are now reflected here. Product/application launch remains outside this database-deployment certification.)

## Overall verdict

| Dimension | Status | Basis |
|---|---|---|
| **Domain completeness** | ✅ **CERTIFIED** | 23-lens board + 4 adversarial passes; no missing domain/aggregate/foundational relationship survived. Excluded (Warehouse/MRP, Retail POS) correctly excluded. |
| **Internal consistency** | ✅ **CERTIFIED** | Synthesis reconciled all reports; contradictions resolved (C1/C2, V1 RLS, ADR-0002/0006/0021 amendments). |
| **Foundation stability** | 🟡 **CONDITIONAL** | Becomes unconditional when Batch 0 + Batch 1 (🔒 items) land. Landed: DC-1 money (SPEC-118), R5 attribution (SPEC-119), DC-16 test net (SPEC-113). Remaining Batch-0: R1–R4/R6/R8 retrofits, INV-1..4. (DC-13 UUIDv7 is DEFERRED — trigger PG18 — and is no longer a gate item.) |
| **Production database deployment** | ✅ **CERTIFIED** | Local and remote migration lists match through `202607049600`; smoke contract is 72 tables, 67 catalog types, 565 catalog values; app RPCs exist in schema `app`; no Edge Functions are implemented in the repository. |
| **Product/application launch readiness** | 🟡 **CONDITIONAL** | Database deployment is complete, but the application UI/runtime surface is not implemented and Phase-8 n8n go-live still needs owner-exclusive credentials. |
| **Tenant isolation / security core** | ✅ **CERTIFIED (audited)** | Default-deny, single RLS primitive (ADR-0013), service_role-only platform access, immutability trigger present. DC-15 bounds the one residual (service_role radius). |
| **SaaS readiness (schema)** | ✅ CERTIFIED | Subscription/entitlement/usage tables ready; runtime lifecycle (RC-1) is unbuilt, not a defect. |
| **AI/RI readiness** | 🟡 CONDITIONAL | Strong (event+RPC surface); N1 event registry and RC-4 Tier-A read-model layer are implemented; conditional items remain capability-specific (for example, DC-18 pgvector for semantic use cases). |

## Conditions for UNCONDITIONAL certification (the gate)
All must be true:
1. Batch 0 complete: DC-16 harness ✅ (SPEC-113); ADRs recorded (+ADR-0002/0006/0021 amendments); R1–R8 (**R5 ✅ SPEC-119**, **R7/DC-1 ✅ SPEC-118** — remaining R1–R4/R6/R8), INV-1..4 landed. (DC-13 UUIDv7 removed — DEFERRED to PG18 trigger, not a Batch-0 gate item.)
2. Batch 1 complete: party+consent, dimensions, event registry, outbox, DC-2/3/4/6/8/9, numbering, i18n, feature-flags.
3. Batch 2 complete: remaining evidence-gated hardening only when its trigger fires (for example, A2 composite indexes on measured volume); already landed items are not gates.
4. `MASTER_DESIGN_CHECKLIST.md` fully checked; pgTAP invariant tests green (RLS coverage, money-currency, append-only).

Until then: **CERTIFIED FOR CONTINUED PHASED IMPLEMENTATION**, not for production launch.

## Conceptual-discovery closure (2026-07-11 session 3)
The Final Design Proof (`final-design-proof-2026-07-11.md`) attacked the **concept/pattern/question** level (beyond tables). It surfaced DC-20…29 (extensibility, Hijri calendar, data residency/PDPL, public-API, tenant-custom roles, retention, plugin SDK, event-sourcing stance, legacy-import/rollback, offline) and then found **nothing beyond them** across a 30-vendor lens sweep + full stress-test battery. **Conclusion: the set of foundation-reopening risks is now closed and enumerated.** The completion statement is **provably FALSE today** for two enumerated reasons only — (1) design lives in reports/ not Canon (ratification pending); (2) DC-20…29 need integrating. It becomes **TRUE** after owner ratification + Batch-0 structural hooks (now incl. `data_region`, `custom_fields`/definitions, `roles.tenant_id`) + canon integration + pgTAP. No open-ended discovery remains.

## Certification history
- **2026-07-09** — Synthesis declared architectural baseline of record (domain-complete, 6 retrofits).
- **2026-07-10** — Independent board added DC-1..9; certified domain-complete, conditional on foundation-lock.
- **2026-07-11 #1** — ARB: added DC-10..18; verified RLS coverage (V1), schema objects (V6: 0 views); established Master knowledge base.
- **2026-07-11 #2** — Design Authority: built blueprint Masters (catalog/ER/flow/coverage/heat); added DC-19; quantified completion ≈84%.
- **2026-07-11 #3** — Final Design Proof: added DC-20..29; closed conceptual discovery; enumerated the exact FALSE→TRUE path. Verdict above.
