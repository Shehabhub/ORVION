# ORVION reports/ — Index & Organization

Governed by `GOVERNANCE.md` (§7). This folder holds analysis, findings, evidence, and history — **never** authoritative business/schema canon (that is `_ORVION_CANONICAL/**`).

**Physical structure (reorganized 2026-07-11, session 9):**
```
reports/
  README.md                      (this index)
  architecture-decision-records.md   (ratified ADR log — top-level authority)
  future-backlog.md                  (deferred work + triggers)
  master/     🟢 Living-Authoritative — findings, plan, blueprint (13)
  evidence/   🔵 Living — decision-validation trail (5)
  history/    🟠 Historical-Immutable — dated review/phase/process reports (26)
```
**Reference convention:** reports are cited by **unique filename** (filenames are globally unique); the subfolder is an organizational detail. So `MASTER_GAP_REGISTER.md` resolves regardless of prose reference — moves never break citations.

> **Where do I write a new finding?** → `evidence/PENDING_ARCHITECTURE_FINDINGS.md` first, then (if validated) `master/MASTER_GAP_REGISTER.md`. See `GOVERNANCE.md §3`. Never edit a 🟠 `history/` file.

## reports/ root — stable authorities

| `README.md` | this index |

## master/ 🟢 — Master documents
| File | SSOT for |
|---|---|
| `MASTER_GAP_REGISTER.md` | **all accepted findings** (others reference its IDs) |
| `MASTER_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` | finding batches (references roadmap phases in canon-32) |
| `MASTER_DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.md` | finding dependencies / ordering |
| `MASTER_RISK_REGISTER.md` | production/compliance risks |
| `MASTER_CERTIFICATION_STATUS.md` | certification state + gate |
| `MASTER_DESIGN_CHECKLIST.md` | design-integration checklist |
| `MASTER_ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md` | proposed/amendment **overlay** (ratified log is at root) |

| `MASTER_REPOSITORY_HEALTH.md` | measurable repo/governance health |

## evidence/ 🔵 — decision-validation trail
| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `VALIDATED_ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md` | findings that passed the 9-stage pipeline |
| `PENDING_ARCHITECTURE_FINDINGS.md` | findings that failed a stage (+ triggers) |
| `REJECTED_ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md` | rejected designs/sub-solutions (+ reasoning) |
| `INDUSTRY_REFERENCES.md` | external evidence library (cited by ref-id) |
| `ARCHITECTURE_PROOF_LOG.md` | every finding's path through the 9 stages |

## history/ 🟠 — immutable session/phase/process records (do not edit)

## Reading order for a newcomer
`master/MASTER_CERTIFICATION_STATUS.md` (where we stand) → `master/MASTER_GAP_REGISTER.md` (what's open) → `master/MASTER_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` (what's next). History is context, read on demand.
