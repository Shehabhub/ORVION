# ORVION Workstation Manifest

**This file is the single source of truth for what the ORVION engineering workstation contains.**
`prepare.ps1` provisions exactly this list; `doctor.ps1` verifies it. Every entry earns its place by
measurable value to ORVION or to the primary engineering agent (Claude Code). Nothing is listed
"because it exists."

## 1. Base tools (required — ORVION cannot be built without these)

| Tool | winget id | Why it earns its place | Verified |
|---|---|---|---|
| Git | `Git.Git` | version control; the repo is the SSOT | ✅ 2.54.0 |
| Node.js LTS | `OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS` | runs `npx supabase`, tooling | ✅ v24.18 |
| Docker Desktop | `Docker.DockerDesktop` | local Supabase/Postgres stack (`supabase start`) | ✅ 29.6.1 |
| Python 3 | `Python.Python.3.12` | base scripting dependency | ✅ 3.12.10 |
| VS Code | `Microsoft.VisualStudioCode` | editor host for all agents/extensions | ✅ 1.129 |
| Supabase CLI | via `npx supabase` (no global install) | migrations, `db reset`, `test db` | ✅ 2.109 |

> Supabase CLI is intentionally **not** installed globally — `npx supabase` pins per-project and avoids a stale global. Verified working this session.

## 2. VS Code extensions

**Auto-installed by `prepare.ps1`** — the minimum ORVION-essential set (a clean, intentional recovery
environment, NOT a copy of anyone's editor):

| Extension | id | Why it earns auto-install |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `anthropic.claude-code` | primary engineering interface — non-negotiable |
| Supabase | `supabase.vscode-supabase-extension` | ORVION *is* Supabase |
| SQLTools | `mtxr.sqltools` | ORVION is SQL/Postgres-heavy |
| PowerShell | `ms-vscode.powershell` | workstation scripts + shell are `.ps1` |
| Docker | `ms-azuretools.vscode-docker` | local Supabase stack runs on Docker |

**Recommended, NOT auto-installed** (owner/personal tools — offered via `.vscode/extensions.json` for
one-click add, but a fresh recovery does not force them): `github.copilot`, `openai.chatgpt` (Codex).
Not required for ORVION development or recovery.

Recommended **removals** (installed but fail Earn-It for ORVION — a local Supabase/Postgres project; user-global, so removal is owner-confirmed, not auto):

| Extension | Why it fails |
|---|---|
| `ms-azuretools.vscode-azure-github-copilot` | Azure — ORVION has no Azure surface |
| `ms-azuretools.vscode-azure-mcp-server` | Azure MCP — irrelevant |
| `ms-azuretools.vscode-azureresourcegroups` | Azure resource mgmt — irrelevant |
| `github.codespaces` | cloud dev environments — ORVION is local |
| `continue.continue` | already removed — overlapped the primary agent |

Kept as owner conveniences (harmless, not part of the reproducible set): gitlens, errorlens, prettier, eslint, markdown/yaml tooling, python support, path-intellisense, etc. — the owner's editor, out of scope for the ORVION manifest.

## 3. Claude plugins

| Plugin | Earn-It verdict |
|---|---|
| GitKraken Hooks | **Keep** — provides durability (auto-commit). Improve commit-message convention (currently `"y"`). |
| Ponytail | **Keep (as-used)** — second-opinion review flow; occasional but real value |
| claude-mem | **Disabled** — `failed to load: cache-miss` + Windows worker never healthy; redundant with file-memory + self-describing repo. Confirmed `false` in global `.claude/settings.json` (2026-07-13) — its dead `UserPromptSubmit` hook was timing out at 60s. Re-enable only if upstream ships a Windows fix. |
| Impeccable (`pbakaus/impeccable`) | **Deferred** — frontend design skill pack (typography/color/motion, UI critique, browser Live Mode). ORVION is backend-only (SQL migrations + RPCs, no UI surface), so it has nothing to act on. Adopt when the first application UI is built — same trigger as Playwright (§4). |

## 4. MCP servers (`.mcp.json` at repo root)

| MCP | Earn-It verdict |
|---|---|
| Postgres MCP (`postgres-local` in `.mcp.json`) | **Adopted** — `@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres` pointed at the local Supabase Postgres; the one MCP that measurably speeds the agent's ORVION work (direct schema/SQL/RLS vs `docker exec`). Uses the standard local dev string (`127.0.0.1:54322`, non-secret); a hosted/remote target would move the string to an env var — never commit a real secret. |
| Context7 | **Keep** — connected, near-zero maintenance, occasional doc lookups |
| Serena / GitHub / Playwright | **Deferred** — Serena (little payoff on a SQL/RPC repo), GitHub (gh CLI suffices), Playwright (no app UI to drive yet) |

## 5. Deliberately excluded (with reason)
- `opencode-ai` (global npm) — third-party AI CLI, not the primary agent, not an owner tool. Removed.
- Claude Mem worker — Windows blocker; see `reports/INCIDENT_CLAUDE_MEM_WINDOWS.md`.

---

**Reversibility:** every removal here is reinstallable (`winget`, `npm i -g`, `code --install-extension`, `claude plugin`). Nothing removed is irrecoverable.

## 6. Scripts (`.workstation/*.ps1`) — what each is and who runs it

The `.ps1` files hold all logic. Two thin entry points feed them: the **remote** `bootstrap.ps1`
(root; run via `irm …/bootstrap.ps1 | iex` on a bare machine — ensures git, clones the repo, hands off
to `prepare.ps1`) and the **local** `workstation.cmd` → `.workstation/menu.ps1` — a **Recovery & Maintenance** launcher
(NOT a dev dashboard). It is **recovery-first**: on launch, if base tools are missing it offers to run
recovery immediately; otherwise it shows maintenance — Prepare/Repair, Verify, Update, Cleanup,
Decommission — with a GitHub-sync header. The menu only dispatches / reads state; no logic lives in it.

**5.1 compatibility (hard constraint):** a fresh Windows machine runs **Windows PowerShell 5.1**, which reads a no-BOM `.ps1` as ANSI (not UTF-8) and lacks PS7-only syntax. All workstation scripts MUST be **pure ASCII** (no em dashes / box-drawing / smart-quotes) and avoid PS7-only syntax (ternary `?:`, `&&`, `||`, `??`). Verify with `powershell.exe` (5.1), not only `pwsh` 7.

`prepare.ps1` is intentionally a single linear script (~60 lines) -
not split into modules, because that would add orchestration overhead without earning it.

| Script | Purpose | When to run | Human? | AI agent? | Auto-called by | Idempotent / safe to repeat |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `prepare.ps1` | **Recover/provision the environment:** install missing base tools (winget) + VS Code extensions + **Claude Code CLI** (npm global) + **project deps** (`npm install` → restores `node_modules` from `package-lock`); point at MCP config; refresh PATH in-session; then verify. Fault-tolerant — continues past failures and prints a summary + the manual re-provisions (Claude login, secrets, stack start). | Once on a fresh machine (menu → **1 Prepare**); re-run to **retry** failed items. | Yes (`workstation.cmd` → 1) | Yes (call `prepare.ps1` directly) | — | ✅ installs only what is missing |
| `doctor.ps1` | Verify the environment (read-only): tools on PATH, key repo files, Docker engine. | Anytime to check health; after `prepare`. | Yes (`workstation.cmd` → 2) | Yes | `prepare.ps1`, `update.ps1` (run it at the end) | ✅ read-only, changes nothing |
| `menu.ps1` | Interactive menu — the single human entry; invokes the scripts above. Refuses non-interactive input. | Whenever a human wants to run any workstation action. | Yes (via `workstation.cmd`) | No (call the `.ps1` scripts directly) | `workstation.cmd` | ✅ no logic of its own |
| `update.ps1` | Periodic maintenance: `winget upgrade` the workstation tools + `npm update -g` Claude Code, continue past failures, print a summary, then verify. (This is the "maintenance" command — update + verify in one; no separate `maintenance.ps1`.) | Occasionally (e.g. monthly). | Yes (run directly) | Optional | — (calls `doctor.ps1` at the end) | ✅ upgrades are no-ops if current |
| `cleanup.ps1` | Remove only transient/obsolete artifacts: retired-experiment env vars, gitignored generated logs, stray backups. Never touches committed files, migrations, or canon. | Rarely, if the tree accumulates transient logs. | Yes (run directly) | Optional | — | ✅ safe; skips what is absent |
| `decommission.ps1` | **Secure decommission** — remove ORVION from this machine (local repo + ORVION env vars; stops the local stack) for retire/sell/replace. Never touches general tools or unrelated data. Recoverable via the bootstrap (GitHub is permanent). | Only when retiring/selling this machine. | Yes (confirmation: type `DECOMMISSION`) | Optional | menu option 5 | ✅ but destructive — confirmation-gated |

`menu.ps1` (interactive, human-only — refuses non-interactive input) is reached via `workstation.cmd`;
it is the one entry point that exposes all four operations, so there are no per-action root launchers
(Earn-It: one launcher, not four). AI agents call the `.ps1` scripts directly.
