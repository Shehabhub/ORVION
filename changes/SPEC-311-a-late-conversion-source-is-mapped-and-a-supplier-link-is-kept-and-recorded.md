## Objective

Batch 6 Slice 52 makes the conversion mapper wait for every conversion source event that has taken its seq but not yet committed, so that a qualification, booking, payment or issuance that commits after a later one is still mapped. It also records every internal supplier link on every door and keeps each link as it was written, so no conversion is lost to commit order and no fulfilment record is made or rewritten unrecorded (CONV-11, ISL-1, ISL-2).

## Business Reason

- **Selection.** CRM's `scripts/batch6_select_target.ps1` at `ca2c189` and this repository's at `463a82d`, each on its live local catalog, rank `events` first (Exposure 6, coverage 400), then `scheduled_job_findings` (5/18) and `internal_supplier_links` (5/18), all NOT-RECORDED. Under the owner's instructions of 2026-11-14, this slice's entry grouped the selector's next three surfaces in one contract per product. Each surface keeps its own finding rows, migration or test, and disposition row. The manifest's Next capability names that selector, never a copy of its result.
- **The twin, adopted by identity.** CRM measured and fixed these findings in its SPEC-308 (`changes/SPEC-308-a-late-conversion-source-is-mapped-and-a-supplier-link-is-kept-and-recorded.md` in CRM; this repository's `SPEC-308` is the unrelated `a-retention-period-changes-only-with-step-up-and-a-record`). At `463a82d`, `supabase/migrations` (tree `41b0844f3ce0531aa793033c2bf298b3ee0900c3`), `supabase/tests` (tree `5dff9bf15abaa1011ee119e85b0967680e1b334a`), `scripts/verify_database.sql` and `reports/master/MASTER_API_CONTRACT.md` (`3ffd2a9820db24d1eaef20f61d27ca245ac8bc81`) equal CRM's at SPEC-308's baseline `ca2c189`; Founder Secondary's ten structural surfaces before the change (`_combined` `f87d6fee4ce1857bc3f35672c7ef8a4e`/3169) equal CRM Primary's before SPEC-308; the two migrations and tests 169 and 170 here are CRM SPEC-308's committed bytes; canon 27 is CRM's text with this repository's ids. CRM's prototype measurements, probes, two-session harness, mutants and causal negatives therefore hold here unchanged; they are cited, not re-run. This contract re-proves the identity, reads Founder Secondary, and runs its own native lifecycle, whose Finish re-runs the DATABASE protocol on the final bytes.
- **Why it matters.**
  - `app.map_outcomes_to_conversions` turns four source events (`lead_qualified`, `booking_created`, `payment_recorded`, `booking_issued`) into the offline conversions delivered to Google Ads. It reads them past its cursor in `integration_cursors` and moves the cursor to the highest `seq` it read.
  - `events.seq` is a `generated always` identity: it is assigned at insert and becomes visible at commit, so seqs do not become visible in order.
  - `internal_supplier_links` is the append-only record of which branch and department fulfil a booking item. Its RPC `app.link_internal_supplier` records `internal_supplier_linked`. SUP-1 brought the RPC's rules to the table door, which every ASSIGN_SUPPLIER holder may write.
- **Measured in CRM at `ca2c189`** on its local stack (CRM SPEC-308). The fixtures were one tenant with an owner, a ceo, a senior employee and two employees in two branches, plus another tenant, two Google Ads call leads, a booking with two items and a link.
  - **CONV-11 (Medium).** Two sessions qualified the two leads, taking seqs 129 and 130. The session holding 130 committed first, and the mapper ran while 129 was still open: it mapped 130 and moved `outcome_conversion_mapper` to 130. After 129 committed, the next run mapped nothing, so that lead's `qualified_phone_call` was never formed. CONV-1's deferral covers a lapsed tenant, not a late commit.
  - **ISL-1 (Low).** A `senior_employee` holding ASSIGN_SUPPLIER linked an item at the table door, and the tenant's events did not move. The same link through the RPC recorded `internal_supplier_linked`.
  - **ISL-2 (Low).** The same senior re-pointed a link's provider to another branch, moved the link to another booking item and back-dated it to 2019, each by UPDATE, and nothing was recorded. The RPC describes the table as append-only and SUP-1 calls it an append-only log, but nothing enforced it.
  - **Why ISL-1 and ISL-2 are Low.** This is SUP-1's measured reason, re-measured here: nothing reads the table but its RPC and `app.guard_write_capability`.
- **The repair: two migrations.**
  - `20261114160000` (CONV-11):
    - `app.record_event`, for the four source types only, takes `pg_advisory_xact_lock_shared` on the key `hashtextextended('app.map_outcomes_to_conversions', 0)` before the event takes its seq, and holds it to commit.
    - `app.map_outcomes_to_conversions` first calls `pg_try_advisory_lock` on the same key. While any source writer is open, it maps nothing and returns 0, and the next run retries from the same cursor.
    - Otherwise it reads `max(seq)` as its horizon, releases the lock at once, and reads both forward windows only up to that horizon. No source seq at or below the horizon can still commit.
    - No writer waits on the mapper, and the mapper waits on no writer. The key form is `app.process_lead_sla`'s.
    - Unchanged: the cursor, the idempotency key, the CONV-1 deferral window and every other rule, and both functions' signatures, security mode and grants.
  - `20261114170000` (ISL-1, ISL-2):
    - `app.emit_internal_supplier_linked` (AFTER INSERT, SECURITY DEFINER, empty `search_path`, executable by no client role) records every link as `internal_supplier_linked`, with the actor, the link id and both org units, at canon 27's `info`. This is SPEC-215's emitter form.
    - `app.link_internal_supplier` no longer records its own event. It hands its reason over through `app.transition_reason`, which the emitter consumes (SPEC-237's pattern), so the RPC records once.
    - `internal_supplier_links_append_only` (BEFORE UPDATE OR DELETE, `app.forbid_mutation`) makes the table append-only for every writer. A new provider is a new link.
  - No grant, policy, RPC signature, event code or cursor rule changes.
- **`scheduled_job_findings` is recorded with no finding.** The mapper's deferral path writes it unchanged. It has no client grant, and its two functions are executable by no client role (tests 66 and 119).
- **Existing files that move, each for a stated reason.**
  - `_ORVION_CANONICAL/27_event_catalog.md`: what `internal_supplier_linked` records.
  - No existing test moves. The generated `MASTER_API_CONTRACT.md` is reproduced byte-identically on the final bytes; it is in Write Scope only because mandatory Check L3 regenerates it, and an Acceptance Criterion proves it unchanged.
- **Swept and found sound, pinned rather than changed:**
  - No client role inserts, updates or deletes an event, and `app.forbid_mutation` binds the table owner too.
  - `app.record_event` refuses another tenant and is not served over REST (API-1).
  - Another branch's and another tenant's events are not read (AUDIT-6).
  - `scheduled_job_findings` refuses an owner at `aal2` to read, insert or call either function.
  - At the link door, an employee without ASSIGN_SUPPLIER and an owner at `aal1` are refused. There is no DELETE grant, and another tenant reads no link.
- **Recorded positions, not repaired:**
  - A signed-in session may call `app.record_event` for its own tenant over a direct database connection, never through the API (API-1's position).
  - A link's `created_at` is caller-supplied on INSERT and read by nothing that decides (SPEC-216's schema-wide question).
  - Links are readable tenant-wide (ids and org units only).
  - A mapper run that meets an open source writer maps nothing, and the next run retries.
- **Latent on Founder Secondary.** `brplkqmbzffpxqgkkdzo` holds 0 tenants, 0 events, 0 offline conversions, 0 findings and 0 links, and the mapper cursor is 0 (read-only through the Founder connector, 2026-11-14, ledger 263 `5df6fd8c73bbe79255e09e30bdc78378`, both targets and the emitter absent). No stored row is affected and no data repair is needed.

## Risks

- **A mapper run that meets an open source writer maps nothing** and returns 0. The cursor does not move, and the next run maps what it skipped. A conversion is delayed by at most one run interval per open writer, never lost. Source transactions are single RPC calls, so a writer open at every run is not expected. No run was measured skipping twice.
- **Every conversion source event takes a shared advisory lock** and holds it to commit. Shared locks never conflict with each other, so source writers do not wait on one another. The mapper holds the exclusive form only between its try and its horizon read, never while it writes.
- **The link table is append-only for every writer**, the platform included. A correction is a new link. No consumer reads links, and no existing test updates or deletes one.
- **Trigger order.** The new AFTER INSERT emitter records after the existing BEFORE guards admit the row. The new BEFORE UPDATE OR DELETE refusal fires before any other trigger on those operations, and the existing triggers are unchanged.
- **Founder Secondary deployment is irreversible.** It runs only under the exact-SHA Gate-2 record of Step 9, and approval of this contract does not authorize it. Both migrations deploy in one sitting. If a stop falls between them, the half-deployed state is recorded in the Execution Log when it happens. Primary `vrvtsxexkiiiivlkdxzp` belongs to CRM and is never contacted.
- **Gate 1 and Gate 2 of this contract are DELEGATED** under the owner's instructions, recorded outside this repository and never as a human-typed digest:
  - class authorization for Batch 6 releases and standing approval of proposals, 2026-11-08 ~10:20 Cairo
  - publish, promote and hosted deploy, ~12:05 Cairo
  - slice 10 in run mode 2, with the slice's own grouping decision, 2026-11-14 ~16:20 Cairo, whose Lane includes this ORVION twin of CRM SPEC-308

## Pre-Approval Evidence

Change Class: Significant

### Draft Assurance

Pass 1 Design: Three surfaces are covered in one contract.

- **`events`.** `app.record_event` takes the shared form of one advisory key for the four source types, and the mapper tries the exclusive form without waiting before it reads its horizon. Its forward windows stop at that horizon.
- **`internal_supplier_links`.** One AFTER INSERT emitter records every link, the RPC hands over its reason, and one BEFORE UPDATE OR DELETE refusal keeps the table append-only.
- **`scheduled_job_findings`.** It is recorded with no change.
- **Tests and records.**
  - Test 169 pins the lock, its form, its release and the horizon, beside one mapped qualification and its replay.
  - Test 170 pins the record on both doors, the consumed reason, append-only for every writer and a session-less link.
  - The register records three new rows, the disposition records the three surfaces, and canon 27 says what `internal_supplier_linked` records.

Pass 2 Adversarial Review: CRM SPEC-308's, adopted with its bytes (every SPEC it cites is blob-identical in this repository); there the design was challenged on the prototype.

- **Rejected designs:**
  - **An exclusive transaction lock that the mapper holds through its writes.** It could deadlock: the mapper's inserts take KEY SHARE on the rows a source writer has locked FOR UPDATE, while that writer waits on the mapper.
  - **A snapshot horizon (`pg_snapshot_xmin`, xid8 on each event).** It would add a column. The mapper tests run in one transaction, so their own events would sit above any xmin, and nine of them would stop proving what they prove.
  - **Moving the cursor only to the lowest open seq.** PostgreSQL does not expose another session's uncommitted identity values, so it cannot be read.
  - **Recording the link event inside the RPC and the door separately.** It would record the RPC's links twice. One emitter is the SPEC-215 form, and the reason hand-over is SPEC-237's.
  - **Revoking UPDATE from `authenticated` instead of a refusal trigger.** A grant binds only client roles, while the history must hold for every writer, the platform included (mutant M2 removes the refusal and is killed).
  - **Copying the selector's next target into the manifest** (SPEC-270; SPEC-278's cancellation).
- **Attacks run on the final bytes.**
  - The two-session harness maps the late qualification on the next run and refuses every rewrite.
  - Every existing test that touches the three surfaces passes, and so does the full suite.
  - The generated API contract does not move.
  - Each held behavior was probed and holds.

Pass 3 Evidence Refresh: 2026-11-14.

- **The identity, re-proven at `463a82d`:**
  - the migrations and tests trees, `scripts/verify_database.sql` and `MASTER_API_CONTRACT.md` equal CRM's at `ca2c189`;
  - the four `supabase/` files written here are CRM SPEC-308's committed blobs;
  - canon 27 equals CRM SPEC-308's with this repository's ids in place of CRM's (`SPEC-309` for `SPEC-306`, `SPEC-310` for `SPEC-307`, `SPEC-311` for `SPEC-308`);
  - the disposition's 78 surface rows carry the same statuses, and the register and disposition were written by the same script with this contract's id, the identity measurement and Founder Secondary in place of Primary.
- **Read read-only on hosted.** Founder Secondary, through the Founder connector: its project URL, ledger, target absence, all ten structural surfaces (equal to CRM Primary's before SPEC-308), the four functions, the triggers of both tables, its counts and the mapper cursor.
- **Adopted by reference.** CRM SPEC-308's measurements on these bytes: the clean reset, tests 169 and 170 alone, pgTAP Pass A and B, the HTTP suites and smoke, the probes and the two-session harness before and after, all nine mutants and the two causal negatives, the structural fingerprints before and after, the API-contract generator (identical), the map generator and consistency.

Selected Version: SPEC-311; selected: the twin of CRM SPEC-308: the smallest repair that closes CONV-11, ISL-1 and ISL-2 (a shared advisory lock that every conversion source event holds to commit and the mapper tries without waiting before it takes its horizon; an AFTER INSERT emitter that records every supplier link on every door; the link table append-only; no grant, policy, RPC signature, event code or cursor rule changed), the two migrations and tests 169-170 byte-identical to CRM, canon 27 CRM's text with this repository's ids, its prototype proof adopted by identity (the same migrations and tests trees and the same pre-change Founder structure)

The `md5(prosrc)` "was" values above are CRM's local stack; Founder Secondary holds `app.record_event` `2ee83b1756511b1e69481487960496b8` and `app.link_internal_supplier` `20ece00b2e00cc181592c0cb28d5e759`, which differ from them only in the line endings of the text it was sent (the normalized function surface is equal), and the mapper `67890da2083509aa6296badb53eb32ba`.

Tests 169 and 170 each declare the ten classes with their N/A classes reasoned. Test 170 carries negative assertions and names both `internal_supplier_links` and `events`, and test 119 names `scheduled_job_findings`, so Check 24 admits `ADVERSARIAL` for all three. Test 169 carries none: its concurrency proof is the two-session harness. Each new row has Owner `—` and is settled. Coverage 57: 33 `AUDITED`, 21 `AUDITED-OPEN`, 3 `PARTIAL`, 0 `EXEMPT`, 21 `NOT-RECORDED`; all 57 `ADVERSARIAL`. |

Checks 21–29 pass. Step 11 makes the measured-state items true, and the one implementation commit is made only after it. |

### Permanent-Control Admission

Applicability: APPLICABLE

Existing Mechanism Reusable: NO

Existing Mechanism: Nothing makes the cursor wait for a seq that is assigned but not yet visible, records a door link, or keeps a link unchanged.

- The mapper advances its cursor to the highest `seq` it read, which is visible only once its writer commits.
- CONV-1's deferral covers a lapsed tenant, never a late commit.
- `app.process_lead_sla`'s try-lock keeps two passes of one job apart. It does not order a job against its sources.
- `app.link_internal_supplier` records its own link only.
- `app.guard_write_capability` and SUP-1's rule trigger decide who may write a link and what it may say, not whether a written link may change.

Added Property: For every writer:

- every conversion source event whose seq the mapper's cursor passes was committed when the mapper took its horizon, so the mapper maps it on that run or a later one;
- every internal supplier link is recorded once with its actor;
- no link is ever changed or deleted.

Causal Negative: Measured in CRM on these bytes and adopted by identity: on the `ca2c189` schema (equal to `463a82d`'s) (the stack reset to `20261114140000`), test 169 fails assertions 3–6 and test 170 fails 1, 3 and 5–11. They fail the same assertions with the pre-repair `app.record_event`, mapper and RPC restored and the two new triggers removed: the same set both ways. There, the two-session harness leaves the late qualification unmapped, and the probes record no door link and accept a link's provider, item and date rewritten by UPDATE.

Positive Test Design: One tenant with a Giza and an Alex branch, a senior employee, a booking with two items, and a Google Ads call lead. Positive controls:

- a qualification is mapped once, and a second run adds nothing;
- a senior's door link and RPC link are each recorded once;
- a session-less link is recorded with no actor;
- a link's first provider is still the one written.

Negative Test Design: by attack class, as follows.
- **Concurrency:** a source event holds the shared lock to commit, and an event that is no source takes none. The mapper tries the exclusive form without waiting, releases it, and stops both forward reads at its horizon. The race itself is the two-session harness: before the repair the late seq is never mapped; after it, the run that meets the open writer maps nothing and the next run maps both.
- **Replay:** a second mapper run adds nothing.
- **Door:** a link made at the table door is recorded like one made through the RPC.
- **State:** a link's provider, item and date cannot be rewritten in place, by a session or by a session-less writer, and no writer deletes one.
- **Privilege:** the emitter is SECURITY DEFINER with no client EXECUTE; the append-only refusal binds the session-less writer too.
- **Observability:** the RPC's link is recorded once with its reason, and the next link in the same transaction carries none.
- **Auth, tenant and input:** the existing guards cover these, unchanged (tests 34, 57, 58 and 81).

Non-Empty Population Obligation: Each test's fixture holds its tenant, branches, users, roles and rows before the first assertion: in 169 a call lead, and in 170 a booking with two items and a senior employee. Each refusal is asserted by its SQLSTATE and exact message, and each record by its exact fields.

Mutation Obligation: Adopted by identity from CRM SPEC-308, whose prototype ran it on these bytes: each mutant is installed inside its test's own rolled-back transaction, proven installed by a diag line (the md5 of the slice functions and the table's trigger count), run, and rolled back. The restored shape is read after the last mutant. A mutant not proven installed is a harness error, never a kill.

| Mutant | Change | Killed on CRM's prototype by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 169 M1 | no source event takes the lock | 169 assertions 3 and 4 |
| 169 M2 | one source type (`booking_issued`) missing from the lock | 169 assertion 4 |
| 169 M3 | the mapper does not try the lock | 169 assertion 5 |
| 169 M4 | one forward read ignores the horizon | 169 assertion 6 |
| 169 M5 | the mapper keeps its lock | 169 assertion 9 |
| 170 M1 | the emitter trigger dropped | 170 assertions 1, 3, 4, 5 and 10 |
| 170 M2 | the append-only trigger dropped | 170 assertions 1, 6–9 and 11 |
| 170 M3 | the reason not consumed | 170 assertion 5 |
| 170 M4 | the RPC's pre-repair body: it records too | 170 assertion 4 |

Post-Implementation Proof Obligation: All of the following on the final bytes, through canonical `-Finish` from the main checkout with the project-local CLI:

- the clean reset, pgTAP Pass A, the declared HTTP suites, pgTAP Pass B and smoke;
- the generated artifacts, repository consistency and the recorded Founder evidence with its parity.

Before Step 10: the identity proof and the fresh Founder Secondary baseline of Step 8; the focused tests, the probes, the two-session harness, the mutants and the causal negatives are CRM SPEC-308's on the same bytes.

## Implementation Steps

1. Check whether `supabase/migrations/20261114160000_a_conversion_source_event_is_mapped_even_when_it_commits_late.sql` contains `CONV-11 -- Batch 6 slice 10`; if so record Already Applied when its Git blob is 03bb907860a50895db5135d8d92778d397c5a8a6, and otherwise stop and report. Otherwise create this file with exactly the following UTF-8 content and one final newline (the events migration: the source lock in record_event and the mapper's horizon), and change nothing else:

   ```text
   -- CONV-11 -- Batch 6 slice 10 (`events`).
   --
   -- THE RULE. `app.map_outcomes_to_conversions` reads conversion source events past its cursor and
   -- moves the cursor to the highest seq it read. A seq is taken when the event is inserted, but the
   -- event becomes visible only when its transaction commits, so seqs do not become visible in order.
   -- Measured before this migration (two sessions, local stack): session A recorded `lead_qualified`
   -- for lead L1 (seq 129) and held its transaction open; session B recorded `lead_qualified` for L2
   -- (seq 130) and committed; the mapper ran, mapped L2 and moved the cursor to 130; A committed; the
   -- next run mapped nothing. L1's qualification never became a conversion, and nothing recorded
   -- that it was lost. The same holds for `booking_created`, `payment_recorded` and `booking_issued`.
   --
   -- THE REPAIR. Every conversion source event is recorded under the shared form of one advisory lock,
   -- held to its commit, and the mapper takes the exclusive form only for the instant it reads its
   -- horizon (the highest committed seq). Granted, it proves no source writer is open, so every source
   -- seq up to the horizon has ended and any later one is taken after it; the run maps only up to the
   -- horizon. Refused, the run maps nothing and the next run retries from the same cursor: a delay,
   -- never a loss. The lock is never held while the mapper writes, so it cannot deadlock with a
   -- writer's row locks, and a writer waits at most for one read of `max(seq)`.
   --
   -- NOT CHANGED: every grant, policy, table and index; every other line of both functions, among them
   -- `record_event`'s authority, validation and insert, and the mapper's window, deferral, recovery
   -- and cursor update. No event type, severity or payload changes.

   ```text
   -- ISL-1, ISL-2 -- Batch 6 slice 10 (`internal_supplier_links`).
   --
   -- THE RULE. A link records which branch and department fulfil a booking item for its owning unit.
   -- `app.link_internal_supplier` appends one ("history preserved; latest row = current provider")
   -- and records `internal_supplier_linked`. `authenticated` holds table-level INSERT and UPDATE, and
   -- PostgREST serves both beside the RPC. Measured before this migration (local stack, a
   -- `senior_employee` holding ASSIGN_SUPPLIER, at aal1 as that role allows):
   --   ISL-1  a link inserted at the table door added no event, where the RPC's added one;
   --   ISL-2  an UPDATE moved a link's provider from Alex to Giza, moved it to another booking item
   --          and back-dated it to 2019, and none of it was recorded: the history the RPC appends
   --          could be rewritten in place.
   --
   -- THE REPAIR, in existing shapes. One AFTER INSERT trigger is the single producer of the event
   -- (SPEC-215's `suppliers_emit_created`), so the RPC loses its own `record_event` call, which would
   -- otherwise record every RPC link twice; the RPC hands the trigger its reason through
   -- `app.transition_reason`, which the trigger consumes (SPEC-237). The actor and time are
   -- `record_event`'s: the session's user, or none on a session-less path. A BEFORE UPDATE OR DELETE
   -- trigger on `app.forbid_mutation` makes the table append-only for every writer, the owner included,
   -- as `events` is: a new provider is a new row, which is what the RPC always did.
   --
   -- NOT CHANGED: every grant, policy and constraint; the integrity and capability guards; the event's
   -- type, entity, severity and payload keys (the payload values are read from the row the guard
   -- derived); and every other line of `app.link_internal_supplier`. A link's caller-supplied
   -- `created_at` on INSERT stays a recorded position (SPEC-216's question, as slices 7-9).

Latent: Founder Secondary holds no event and no conversion. **Repaired:** `app.record_event` takes the shared form of a transaction-level advisory lock keyed on the mapper for the four source types the mapper reads (`lead_qualified`, `booking_created`, `payment_recorded`, `booking_issued`) before the event takes its seq, and holds it to commit. `app.map_outcomes_to_conversions` first tries the exclusive form without waiting: while any source writer is open it maps nothing and returns 0, and the next run retries from the same cursor; otherwise it reads `max(seq)` as its horizon, releases the lock at once, and reads its forward window only up to that horizon, so no source seq at or below it can still commit.

The race itself needs two live sessions and is proven by the slice's harness: before the repair the qualification that committed late was never mapped; after it, the run that met the open writer mapped nothing and the next run mapped both.

   The resulting file's Git blob is 945a806b3eefbfdd1cb16272b0086566e713e522.

8. **Check** for a `Pre-deploy readiness gate` Execution Log entry. If absent, with Steps 1–7 applied and uncommitted in the main checkout, record, with actual values:
   - the SHA-256, md5 and byte counts of the two migrations and tests 169 and 170, which must equal Consumer Closure, and the Git blobs of the four `supabase/` files, which must equal CRM SPEC-308's; canon 27 must equal CRM SPEC-308's with `SPEC-309`, `SPEC-310` and `SPEC-311` read for CRM's `SPEC-306`, `SPEC-307` and `SPEC-308`;
   - the identity: `supabase/migrations` and `supabase/tests` at the baseline equal CRM's at `ca2c189` (trees `41b0844f3ce0531aa793033c2bf298b3ee0900c3` and `5dff9bf15abaa1011ee119e85b0967680e1b334a`), and the `supabase/` paths changed equal those CRM SPEC-308 changed, so CRM SPEC-308's prototype results (the four functions' shape, tests 169 and 170 alone, the probes and the two-session harness, the nine mutants, the two causal negatives and the structural fingerprints before and after) hold here; they are cited, not re-run;
   - after a clean reset of the local stack by this repository's CLI, the API-contract generator, whose output must equal `MASTER_API_CONTRACT.md`; the map generator, the scope check and `git diff --check`.

   Treat as expected at this boundary only: an undeployed Founder Secondary and the measured-state items of Consumer Closure.

   Then read a fresh Founder Secondary baseline through the Founder connector, read-only:
   - the project URL, the full ordered ledger and the absence of both target migrations;
   - the function and structural surfaces, which must equal CRM Primary's before SPEC-308 (`_combined` `f87d6fee4ce1857bc3f35672c7ef8a4e`/3169);
   - the triggers of the two tables and the four functions' `md5(prosrc)`;
   - the tenant, event, offline conversion, finding and link counts.

   Record the predicted delta. If any reading differs, stop.
9. **Check** that an exact-SHA Gate-2 record for the two migrations is in the Execution Log. It is either the owner's own, or one marked DELEGATED that names this contract, each migration's SHA-256, Founder Secondary `brplkqmbzffpxqgkkdzo` and the owner's instructions under which it is taken. If it is absent, write it only when Step 8 passed and those instructions cover migrations that drop no table or column and delete or rewrite no business row. Otherwise stop after Step 8 and present the Gate-2 package.
10. **Check** which of `20261114160000_a_conversion_source_event_is_mapped_even_when_it_commits_late` and `20261114170000_an_internal_supplier_link_is_appended_and_recorded_on_every_door` Founder Secondary `brplkqmbzffpxqgkkdzo` lacks. If Step 9 is recorded, deploy each one it lacks in version order, in one sitting:
    - Immediately re-read HEAD, the hashes, the project URL, the full ordered ledger, the target's absence, the business counts and the triggers of the two tables.
    - On an exact match, prove the transmitted text's md5 server-side, then apply only that migration through the Founder write connector `supabase-secondary-write`, after its `get_project_url` names `brplkqmbzffpxqgkkdzo`.
    - If the connector assigns a temporary version, rename only that one newly inserted ledger row. The rename requires exactly one new row other than this contract's own versions, its stored statement md5 equal to the file's, and no existing target version.
    - If a stop falls between the two, record the half-deployed ledger in the Execution Log before anything else.

    Then read fresh through the Founder connector: the ledger, the function surface and all ten structural surfaces, with the exact `read_query` recorded in `reports/evidence/founder-ledger-evidence.json`; the triggers of the two tables; the four functions' `md5(prosrc)`, security mode and ACL; and the business counts. Never contact Primary `vrvtsxexkiiiivlkdxzp`.
11. **Check** that fresh Founder evidence contains each of the two new migrations exactly once. If so:
    - Update `reports/evidence/founder-ledger-evidence.json` (schema 3) from those readings only: `read_at`, `read_via`, the unchanged `read_query`, `repository_head` (the HEAD at the read), the full ledger, its count and fingerprint, both surface hashes and counts, and `surface_rows`. `scripts/check_primary_ledger.ps1` and `scripts/check_database_parity_evidence.ps1` must then pass.
    - In `_ORVION_CANONICAL/manifest.md`, set `Live state` from the same readings in its existing form (migration count, latest, ledger, and the two surface hashes and counts), with **80 client RPCs** unchanged.
    - Confirm that `supabase/tests` holds 170 files whose literal `plan(N)` values sum to 3172, then set `Suite **170 files / 3172 assertions**`. If either differs, stop.
    - In the register, replace each `` | 🛡 | **FIXED 2026-11-14 locally (SPEC-311, `V`); Founder Secondary deployment pending.** `` with `` | ✅ | **✅ FIXED 2026-11-14 (SPEC-311, `V`), DEPLOYED to Founder Secondary under the exact-SHA Gate-2 record of SPEC-311; the fresh Founder ledger, functions and structure equal local.** ``, for V `20261114160000` (the one row CONV-11) and `20261114170000` (the two rows ISL-1 and ISL-2). Each span's one leading and one trailing space are delimiters, not text. Change nothing else in the register.
    - Confirm that the canonical API-contract generator still reproduces `MASTER_API_CONTRACT.md` unchanged, and regenerate `ai-map.json` and `repository-index.md` (stored LF) with the canonical generator.
    - Set the Runtime Checkpoint to DONE, append the Execution Log, and commit the implementation once. The pre-commit Gate must admit it.

    If Founder Secondary is unproven, stop.
12. **Check** for a `Post-deploy local certification` Execution Log entry. If absent:
    - Run canonical `-Finish` through `scripts/run_timed.ps1`, watched by `scripts/watch_run.ps1`, and require `LOCAL_CERTIFY: READY`.
    - Independently Review the committed implementation against every Acceptance Criterion. After `Verdict: Confirmed Complete`, make the Complete commit:
      - transition to Complete and tick the Acceptance Criteria and the Review Gate;
      - clear `Active Change Request` and set `Last Completed` from Notes;
      - leave `Next capability` and `Current Module` unchanged;
      - regenerate `ai-map.json` and `repository-index.md` LF.
    - Bind the exact candidate with `-Gate -BindCandidate`. Publication and promotion follow the native release path separately.

- [ ] The identity with CRM SPEC-308 is proven (payload blobs, canon 27 with this repository's ids, migrations and tests trees, Founder Secondary's pre-change structure), so its nine mutants, each killed with installation proven and the restored shape read, its two causal negatives and its two-session harness, before and after, hold here.

## Execution Log

### 2026-11-14 — Steps 1–7 applied

- **Lifecycle:** allocate `c5cc9de`, Approve `b086a16` (APPROVAL_EVIDENCE PASS; 12 of 14 criteria Gate-checked), DELEGATED Gate 1 recorded in Verification Notes.
- **Steps 1–7** by the literal-step replay, each result at its pinned blob: migrations `03bb907860a50895db5135d8d92778d397c5a8a6` and `05dba10af68f95fbd3e7ff107998fc7fdea40e02`; tests 169 `b96649cac86917ef99cfe457abc84e4f76ebf4fb` and 170 `d4e2901ff0bffe38168a2d484b2f6e5efc88d4cb` (CRM SPEC-308's committed blobs); canon 27 `37c7d87011e4d14ec265b51a6b7a57fe7917cc0b`; register `0438b546aa0611efe03ec300e8049630c954f633`; disposition `945a806b3eefbfdd1cb16272b0086566e713e522`; 0 mismatches. Uncommitted until Step 11: the pre-commit guard refuses the measured-state items before the deploy.

### 2026-11-14 — Pre-deploy readiness gate (Step 8)

From the main checkout at HEAD `b086a16`, Steps 1–7 applied and uncommitted, project-local CLI 3.0.0, the local stack recreated by the rig, one logged script (17:55–17:56 Cairo):
- **Bytes**, all LF (0 CR) and ASCII, equal to Consumer Closure: migration `20261114160000` SHA-256 `38f8419e49b8a4a899ac94dac8ec21460a2dab0d29796cb11f8e4f4aec962eb9`, md5 `bad439fd0afb9c2b281ee56ac7e66c3c`, 15551 bytes; `20261114170000` SHA-256 `df7d6433c9c1bd4c6485bf73b627e761c38f931d768fa4a20297bc294065a057`, md5 `e7ab821346241cb45d4e72f7a8ba2f70`, 6149 bytes; test 169 SHA-256 `3dd91b7482963b2aa66a778e3ec53cfc11ff466e4ba8bea5590eec903e35c269`; test 170 SHA-256 `cf099ff047d5503cccfb28d4114ef104fd7deaccaff4c349038b49a0694306eb`.
- **Identity with CRM SPEC-308** (implementation `850287f` in CRM): the four `supabase/` files' Git blobs equal CRM's; canon 27 equals CRM SPEC-308's with `SPEC-309`, `SPEC-310` and `SPEC-311` for CRM's `SPEC-306`, `SPEC-307` and `SPEC-308`; at the baseline, `supabase/migrations` (`41b0844f`), `supabase/tests` (`5dff9bf1`), `scripts/verify_database.sql` (`1584d5e3`) and `MASTER_API_CONTRACT.md` (`3ffd2a98`) equal CRM's at `ca2c189`; the same four `supabase/` paths changed here as in CRM SPEC-308; the disposition's 78 surface statuses equal CRM's. CRM SPEC-308's Step 8 results on these bytes are therefore cited, not re-run: the four functions' shape, tests 169 10/10 and 170 11/11, the probes and the two-session harness before and after, nine mutants killed with the restored shapes equal, the two causal negatives, parity 263 `f87d6fee…`/3169 → 265 `aeb5931b…`/3172.
- **Local stack** after a clean reset by this repository's CLI (exit 0, 33 s): ledger 265 `2a17e52e8270cf7bb2e546dbb0c9f591`, latest `20261114170000`; `md5(prosrc)` `app.record_event` `63c530c75036e3b50c21ca7e2222415a`, the mapper `103290e8791a537d15c0192b27469861`, `app.link_internal_supplier` `53a7eecb49d9d43e04d59939d7a3b533`, `app.emit_internal_supplier_linked` `2ab772b33b2e17c270f0b7c16d936b40` (`{postgres=X/postgres}`); `parity_surface.sql` functions `58dc8cf1aaec56b1ba63eabf7391ac0a`/347, triggers `b4a4d2babd4fa85cf46268d2b934268a`/334, `_combined` `aeb5931b5df96106439433dce07cfe2a`/3172, equal to CRM's local stack after SPEC-308.
- **Generators, scope and diff.** The API-contract generator's output equals `MASTER_API_CONTRACT.md` byte for byte; `generate-ai-map.ps1 -Check` exit 0. Only the seven Step 1–7 paths changed; `git diff --check` clean.
- **Consistency:** exactly the six expected pre-deploy items, the same as the sandbox: 263 vs 265 migrations, latest, ledger fingerprint, 168 vs 170 files, 3151 vs 3172 assertions, RECOVER-1 (Founder evidence).
- **Fresh Founder Secondary baseline**, read-only (15:45:43 UTC by the server clock, through the Founder write connector inside `BEGIN TRANSACTION READ ONLY`): URL `https://brplkqmbzffpxqgkkdzo.supabase.co`; ledger 263 `5df6fd8c73bbe79255e09e30bdc78378`, latest `20261114140000`, both targets absent by version and by name; `app.link_internal_supplier` `20ece00b2e00cc181592c0cb28d5e759`, the mapper `67890da2083509aa6296badb53eb32ba`, `app.record_event` `2ee83b1756511b1e69481487960496b8` (stored text line endings differ from CRM Primary's; the whitespace-normalized function surface is equal), each with the local security mode and ACL; no emitter; the 4 triggers of the two tables; `internal_supplier_linked` at 68; catalog 71/626; 0 tenants, 0 events, 0 offline conversions, 0 findings, 0 links; mapper cursor 0. `parity_surface.sql`: functions `0b3b9c82bb521f6744950201471196a6`/346, triggers `d241997ceaab37c02327503b4e2587cb`/332, `_combined` `f87d6fee4ce1857bc3f35672c7ef8a4e`/3169, every surface equal to CRM Primary's before SPEC-308 and to the recorded evidence.
- **Predicted delta:** ledger 265 `2a17e52e…`; functions `58dc8cf1…`/347; triggers `b4a4d2ba…`/334; `_combined` `aeb5931b…`/3172; the four function hashes of the local stack (the deployed text is the LF files); the two new triggers; catalog 71/626 unchanged; business counts unchanged.

### 2026-11-14 — Gate 2 (Step 9), DELEGATED

DELEGATED exact-SHA Gate-2 record for SPEC-311, to Founder Secondary `brplkqmbzffpxqgkkdzo` only, in version order and in one sitting: `supabase/migrations/20261114160000_a_conversion_source_event_is_mapped_even_when_it_commits_late.sql`, SHA-256 `38f8419e49b8a4a899ac94dac8ec21460a2dab0d29796cb11f8e4f4aec962eb9`, md5 `bad439fd0afb9c2b281ee56ac7e66c3c`, 15551 bytes; `supabase/migrations/20261114170000_an_internal_supplier_link_is_appended_and_recorded_on_every_door.sql`, SHA-256 `df7d6433c9c1bd4c6485bf73b627e761c38f931d768fa4a20297bc294065a057`, md5 `e7ab821346241cb45d4e72f7a8ba2f70`, 6149 bytes; under the owner's instructions of 2026-11-08 (class authorization for Batch 6 releases and standing approval of proposals ~10:20 Cairo; publish, promote and hosted deploy ~12:05 Cairo), 2026-11-11 (Batch 6 decisions 1-9 ~19:50 Cairo, decision 8 the twin lane), 2026-11-12 (priority order waiving no gate ~12:20 Cairo) and 2026-11-14 (one contract per product ~11:30 Cairo; no credential rotation ~12:30 Cairo; slice 10 in run mode 2 and BP-32's one-sitting deploy ~16:20 Cairo), recorded outside this repository. Step 8 passed. The migrations' top-level statements are four `create or replace function`, one `revoke execute` and two `create trigger`: they drop no table or column and delete or rewrite no business row. Not a human-typed digest. Primary `vrvtsxexkiiiivlkdxzp` is not a target.

### 2026-11-14 — Founder Secondary deployment (Step 10)

Through the Founder write connector `supabase-secondary-write` from this VS Code session, after its `get_project_url` named `https://brplkqmbzffpxqgkkdzo.supabase.co`, 15:58–16:01 UTC by the server clock, in version order and in one sitting; Primary `vrvtsxexkiiiivlkdxzp` not contacted:
- **Immediate re-read before each, exact match** (inside `BEGIN TRANSACTION READ ONLY`). HEAD `b086a1637586f333cbf863d47c1404807ada3f94`; the two files' SHA-256 as in Step 8. Before `20261114160000` (15:58:01 UTC): ledger 263 `5df6fd8c73bbe79255e09e30bdc78378`, both targets absent by version and by name, functions and triggers as in Step 8. Before `20261114170000` (16:00:44 UTC): ledger 264 `f6f71e89ec027b0a23dd33b5b339ac1d`, equal to the migration files through `20261114160000`, its two functions at their Step 8 hashes, `app.link_internal_supplier` still `20ece00b…`. Each time 0 tenants, 0 events, 0 offline conversions, 0 findings, 0 links, 626 catalog values.
- **Transmitted text** proven server-side in the same read, each equal to its file: md5 `bad439fd0afb9c2b281ee56ac7e66c3c` and `e7ab821346241cb45d4e72f7a8ba2f70`. Each applied once with `apply_migration` under its own name.
- **Guarded renames.** The connector stored versions `20261114160004` and `20261114160101`: each time exactly one new row other than this contract's own versions, one stored statement with the file's md5 and byte count (15551, 6149), no existing target. One guarded `UPDATE` each (row count required 1) renamed them to `20261114160000` and `20261114170000`. The half-deployed window (15:58–16:01 UTC) closed inside the sitting.
- **Fresh reads** (16:01:24–16:02:16 UTC). Ledger 265 `2a17e52e8270cf7bb2e546dbb0c9f591`, latest `20261114170000`, equal to the migration files; `parity_surface.sql`: functions `58dc8cf1aaec56b1ba63eabf7391ac0a`/347, triggers `b4a4d2babd4fa85cf46268d2b934268a`/334, the other eight surfaces unchanged, `_combined` `aeb5931b5df96106439433dce07cfe2a`/3172, each equal to the local stack after a clean reset and to CRM Primary's after SPEC-308; the evidence function expression `58dc8cf1…`/347; the four functions' `md5(prosrc)` equal to the local stack (`63c530c7…`, `103290e8…`, `53a7eecb…`, `2ab772b3…`), with their security modes and ACLs as local; the six triggers of the two tables equal to local, with `internal_supplier_links_emit_linked` and `internal_supplier_links_append_only` added; `internal_supplier_linked` at 68; catalog 71/626; 0 tenants, 0 events, 0 offline conversions, 0 findings, 0 links; mapper cursor 0. No business row was written.

### 2026-11-14 — Post-deploy records (Step 11)

- `reports/evidence/founder-ledger-evidence.json` (schema 3) from the Step 10 readings only (read 2026-11-14 16:02:16 UTC, `repository_head` `b086a16`): 265 entries whose fingerprint recomputes to `2a17e52e…`, functions `58dc8cf1…`/347, structure `aeb5931b…`/3172, the functions, triggers and `_combined` surface rows; `read_query` unchanged. `scripts/check_primary_ledger.ps1` (RECOVER-1 CLEAN) and `scripts/check_database_parity_evidence.ps1` (FOUNDER PARITY EVIDENCE CLEAN) pass.
- Manifest `Live state` set from the same readings in its existing form; **80 client RPCs** unchanged. `supabase/tests` holds 170 files whose literal `plan(N)` sum to 3172; `Suite **170 files / 3172 assertions**`.
- The three register rows (CONV-11, ISL-1, ISL-2) replaced with the DEPLOYED text, 1 + 2 spans, nothing else changed.
- The canonical API-contract generator reproduces `MASTER_API_CONTRACT.md` (unchanged); `ai-map.json` and `repository-index.md` regenerated, LF. `scripts/check_repository_consistency.ps1`: CLEAN.
- Runtime Checkpoint DONE; Status Approved → In Progress; one implementation commit.
## Verification Notes

None.


### 2026-11-14 — Gate 1 approval recorded

DELEGATED exact Gate1 under the owner's instructions of 2026-11-08 (class authorization for Batch 6 releases and standing approval of proposals ~10:20 Cairo; publish, promote and hosted deploy ~12:05 Cairo), 2026-11-11 (Batch 6 decisions 1-9 ~19:50 Cairo, whose decision 8 is the twin lane), 2026-11-12 (priority order waiving no gate ~12:20 Cairo) and 2026-11-14 (one contract per product ~11:30 Cairo; no credential rotation ~12:30 Cairo; slice 10 in run mode 2 with its own grouping decision ~16:20 Cairo, whose Lane includes this ORVION twin of CRM SPEC-308); Draft SHA-256 017D2A8BD395DBBB5E7919F0D91F063679508D56CCB5414D5C79C7099A3EC846, decision SHA-256 6CEE4B8971506D06336129C0834313A597AFF9030FC18DB0CB5A4610475ABA2A. No fabricated human future-digest approval. Gate 2 (Founder Secondary deploy) is a separate exact-SHA record in Step 9. Immediately before allocation the hash, the Draft blob 1b2d9cfd9f4e3e7ac8b077277167545608c71eb2, all 3 source anchors, the baseline HEAD 463a82d3d5ca317115aa4e019a816470ce955b2c against refreshed origin/main 463a82d3d5ca317115aa4e019a816470ce955b2c and a clean checkout were revalidated, and the pre-commit allocator admitted the identity; Draft allocated as c5cc9de. No implementation performed before this transition.

## Notes

After actual native Finish and truthful Review, synchronize only this contract and the declared manifest/discovery paths to Complete. Set `Last Completed: **SPEC-311: Batch 6 Slice 52 — a conversion source event that commits late is still mapped; every internal supplier link is recorded on every door and never rewritten (CONV-11, ISL-1, ISL-2), the twin of CRM SPEC-308, deployed to Founder Secondary; native verification and Review complete. Publication/promotion remain separately governed.**` and regenerate discovery. `Next capability` and `Current Module` stay unchanged: the selector names the next slice. Candidate binding follows Complete and is never a pre-Complete criterion.
