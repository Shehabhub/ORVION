# Entity Registry

Version: 0.1
Status: Draft
Canonical: Yes

---

# Purpose

This document defines the first official ORVION entities before database schema design.

It defines what each entity represents and why it exists.

It does not define final database columns.

---

# Entity Design Rules

- Every entity must support a real travel agency workflow.
- Every tenant-owned business entity must be tenant-scoped.
- Operational entities must preserve historical ownership.
- Important business records are archived, not physically deleted.
- Events record meaningful business milestones.
- Catalog values are defined separately in `25_catalog_registry.md`.
- Table design is defined later in `31_schema_draft.md`.
