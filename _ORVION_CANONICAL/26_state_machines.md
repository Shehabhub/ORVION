# State Machines

Version: 0.2
Status: Draft
Canonical: Yes

---

# Purpose

This document defines allowed state transitions for ORVION core workflows.

No operational status should move freely without an allowed transition.

Every meaningful state transition must create an event.

---

# State Machine Rules

- Status values must come from `25_catalog_registry.md`.
- State transitions must be validated by application logic and, where practical, database constraints.
- Terminal records are not physically deleted.
- Reopening is allowed only through explicit workflow rules.
- Every state transition must record actor, timestamp, previous state, new state, and reason where applicable.

---

# Lead State Machine

## States

- new
- assigned
- contacted
- qualified
- quotation_sent
- negotiation
- won
- converted
- lost
- spam
- duplicate

## Normal Flow

```text
new
  -> assigned
  -> contacted
  -> qualified
  -> quotation_sent
  -> negotiation
  -> won
  -> converted
```

## Allowed Transitions

| From | To | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| new | assigned | Lead assigned by routing or authorized user |
| new | spam | Invalid or spam intake |
| new | duplicate | Existing active lead/customer detected |
| assigned | contacted | Phone/WhatsApp/contact interaction recorded |
| assigned | assigned | Reassignment event only; lead remains assigned |
| assigned | lost | Allowed with closure reason |
| assigned | duplicate | Existing lead/customer confirmed |
| contacted | qualified | Customer need confirmed |
| contacted | lost | Allowed with closure reason |
| contacted | spam | Contact proves spam |
| qualified | quotation_sent | Quotation sent to customer |
| qualified | won | Customer agrees without formal quotation |
| qualified | lost | Allowed with closure reason |
| quotation_sent | negotiation | Customer negotiates price/details |
| quotation_sent | won | Customer accepts quotation |
| quotation_sent | lost | Allowed with closure reason |
| negotiation | won | Customer accepts |
| negotiation | lost | Allowed with closure reason |
| won | converted | Customer and/or booking created |
| duplicate | assigned | Only if duplicate classification was wrong and reopened by authorized user |
| lost | assigned | New attempt or reopening with reason |
| spam | assigned | Only if spam classification was wrong and reopened by authorized user |
```

Note:

`reassigned` is not a lead status. It is an assignment event.

## Terminal States

Terminal unless reopened by authorized action:

- converted
- lost
- spam
- duplicate

## Required Events

- lead_created
- lead_assigned
- lead_reassigned
- lead_contacted
- lead_qualified
- lead_quotation_sent
- lead_negotiation_started
- lead_won
- lead_converted
- lead_lost
- lead_marked_spam
- lead_marked_duplicate
- lead_reopened

---

# Lead SLA State Logic

Lead SLA is not a status field. It is derived from assignment and interaction events.

## SLA Rule

If assigned lead has no qualifying interaction within 15 minutes:

- Create lead_sla_warning event.
- Notify assigned employee.
- Notify manager.

If another 15 minutes pass without qualifying interaction:

- Reassign lead to another eligible employee.
- Create lead_reassigned event.

## Qualifying Interaction

Any of the following counts as response:

- phone_call
- whatsapp_message
- chat_opened
- customer_reply
- lead status changed by authorized user for a valid reason

# Booking State Machine

## States

- draft
- pending_approval
- confirmed
- in_progress
- issued
- void
- refunded
- reissue
- completed
- cancelled

## Principle

Booking status summarizes the whole booking.

Execution detail lives on booking items.

## Normal Flow

```text
draft
  -> pending_approval
  -> confirmed
  -> in_progress
  -> issued
  -> completed
```

## Allowed Transitions

| From | To | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| draft | pending_approval | Booking submitted for finance/management approval |
| draft | cancelled | Booking cancelled before approval |
| pending_approval | confirmed | Required approval granted |
| pending_approval | cancelled | Approval rejected or customer cancelled |
| confirmed | in_progress | Operations started |
| confirmed | cancelled | Customer or company cancels before service execution |
| in_progress | issued | One or more issuable items issued |
| in_progress | completed | Non-ticket booking completed without issued state |
| in_progress | cancelled | Allowed with cancellation workflow |
| issued | completed | All required services completed |
| issued | void | Void workflow applies |
| issued | reissue | Reissue workflow applies |
| issued | refunded | Refund workflow applies |
| void | completed | Void finalized with finance impact resolved |
| reissue | issued | Reissued service issued |
| refunded | completed | Refund finalized |
```

## Terminal States

- completed
- cancelled

Terminal states may not be edited directly. Corrections require adjustment events or authorized reopening in a future policy.

## Required Events

- booking_created
- booking_submitted_for_approval
- booking_confirmed
- booking_in_progress
- booking_issued
- booking_voided
- booking_reissue_started
- booking_refunded
- booking_completed
- booking_cancelled

---

# Booking Item Base State Machine

## States

- draft
- pending
- confirmed
- in_progress
- completed
- cancelled
- no_show

## Normal Flow

```text
draft
  -> pending
  -> confirmed
  -> in_progress
  -> completed
```

## Allowed Transitions

| From | To | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| draft | pending | Item submitted for approval or supplier action |
| draft | completed | Allowed only for simple already-completed manual item with authorized permission |
| draft | cancelled | Booking item cancelled before confirmation |
| pending | confirmed | Supplier/finance/operations confirms item |
| pending | draft | Returned for correction |
| pending | cancelled | Booking item cancelled while pending |
| confirmed | in_progress | Work starts or service execution begins |
| confirmed | completed | Allowed when service does not require in-progress step |
| confirmed | cancelled | Booking item cancelled after confirmation, per cancellation workflow |
| confirmed | no_show | Passenger/traveler did not show for a time-bound service |
| in_progress | completed | Service completed |
| in_progress | cancelled | Booking item cancelled during execution, per cancellation workflow |
| in_progress | no_show | Passenger/traveler did not show during execution |
```

## Terminal States

- cancelled
- no_show

Terminal states may not be edited directly. Corrections require adjustment events or authorized reopening in a future policy, consistent with the Booking State Machine's terminal-state rule.

## Sub-Status Rule

Service-specific sub-status may change inside the base lifecycle.

Examples:

- Ticket: reserved, ticketed, reissued, void
- Visa: documents_pending, embassy_submitted, approved, rejected
- Hotel: reserved, confirmed, checked_in, checked_out

Sub-status transitions must create events but do not require separate tables.

## Required Events

- booking_item_created
- booking_item_pending
- booking_item_confirmed
- booking_item_in_progress
- booking_item_completed
- booking_item_sub_status_changed
- booking_item_cancelled
- booking_item_no_show_recorded
