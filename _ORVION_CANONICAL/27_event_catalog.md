# Event Catalog

Version: 0.2
Status: Draft
Canonical: Yes

---

# Purpose

This document defines ORVION's meaningful immutable events.

Events are used to understand the full history of a lead, customer, booking, payment, document, subscription, and security action.

---

# Event Principles

- Every important business action creates an event.
- Events are immutable.
- Events are not physically deleted.
- Events are tenant-scoped where applicable.
- Events must identify actor, target entity, timestamp, and event type.
- Events should record meaningful business milestones, not every UI click.
- Events support timeline views, audit, notifications, reporting, and troubleshooting.
- Canonical event-entity linkage uses the polymorphic entity_type / entity_id pattern as specified in 31_schema_draft.md (see Review Required item #1).

---

# Event Severity

## info

Normal business event.

## warning

Needs attention but does not block the system.

## risk

Business or financial risk was accepted.

## security

Authentication, authorization, or permission event.

## critical

Sensitive or high-impact action.

---

# Event Payload Rule

Event payload may store structured context, but it must not become the primary database model.

Examples of acceptable payload:

- Previous status
- New status
- Reason
- Amount snapshot
- Assignment target
- Approval source
- External delivery response

Do not store full entity records only inside event payload.

# As-built additions & alignments (2026-07-17, evidence-backed sync)

Implementation (Phases 5–7 RPCs) extended the vocabulary beyond v0.2; the emitted codes are the
as-built truth (empty DB, no rename cost). Renamed in place above (unused draft names → emitted
names): internal_supplier_link_created → internal_supplier_linked; receipt_created →
receipt_issued; refund_created → refund_requested. Added below (emitted by issue_invoice /
record_payment / record_supplier_payment):

## invoice_issued

Invoice moved to issued.

## invoice_partially_paid

Invoice partially settled by payment allocation.

## invoice_paid

Invoice fully settled.

## supplier_payment_recorded

Supplier payment recorded against payable.
