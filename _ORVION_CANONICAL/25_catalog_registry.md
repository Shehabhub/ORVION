# Catalog Registry

Version: 0.2
Status: Draft
Canonical: Yes

---

# Purpose

This document defines ORVION controlled values before database schema design.

Any dropdown-like value used by employees must come from a controlled catalog.

Employees must not create operational statuses, document types, service types, roles, or permission keys freely inside daily forms.

---

# Catalog Design Rules

- Catalogs prevent random employee input.
- System-critical catalogs are global and controlled by ORVION.
- Tenant-customizable catalogs may be extended by authorized tenant users where allowed.
- Status catalogs must be linked to state machines in `26_state_machines.md`.
- Catalog values must use stable machine codes.
- Display labels can be localized later.
- Deleted catalog values should be deactivated, not physically deleted, if already used.

---

# Catalog Classification Types

## System Catalog

Controlled by ORVION platform.

Tenant users cannot add or rename values.

Used for:

- Core statuses
- System permissions
- Security events
- Subscription plans
- Offline conversion delivery states

## Tenant Catalog

Controlled per tenant by authorized tenant users.

Used for:

- Some supplier classifications
- Some service naming extensions
- Tenant-specific business labels where safe

## Reference Data

Stable public or semi-public datasets that are not operational dropdowns owned by employees.

Used for:

- Countries
- Cities
- Currencies
- Languages
- Nationalities
- Airports where needed later

Status:

- Currencies: Implemented — see `31_schema_draft.md`, Reference Tables (`currencies`).
- Countries, Cities, Languages, Nationalities, Airports: Not yet implemented as dedicated reference tables; current fields (e.g. `nationality_code`, `destination_country_code`, `preferred_language_code`) remain free-standing codes pending a documented business requirement for validated lookups at that granularity.

Rule:

Do not store reference datasets inside generic `catalog_values` unless there is a strong business reason.

Reference data should use dedicated reference tables or seeded reference datasets.

## Tenant-Extendable System Catalog

Has ORVION default values but may allow tenant additions.

Used only when additions do not break core workflows.

# Reference Data

The following datasets are Reference Data and should not be stored in generic `catalog_values` by default:

- countries
- cities
- currencies
- languages
- nationalities
- airports

Recommended storage:

- Dedicated reference tables
- Seeded data
- Stable ISO-like codes where available

Usage examples:

- `destination_country_code`
- `currency_code`
- `preferred_language_code`
- `nationality_code`
- `passport_issuing_country_code`

Rule:

Only move reference data into catalog_values if tenant-specific customization becomes a real business requirement.

# Deferred Catalogs

The following catalogs are deferred until their modules are approved:

- Tax codes
- Depreciation methods
- GDS provider codes
- Payroll statuses
- Full workflow engine action types
- Data warehouse dimensions
- Marketplace extension types

# Next Step

Create `26_state_machines.md`.
