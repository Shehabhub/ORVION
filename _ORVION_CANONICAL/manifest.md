# Purpose

This document tells any agent or human where the project currently stands.

It exists to answer one question: what phase, task, and Change Request is active right now.

For where to begin, what to read, and who governs conduct, see `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` — this document does not restate their responsibilities.

This file should always reflect the current state of the project.

# Current Development Status

Update this section continuously.

Current Phase: Phase 3 — Identity And Access (application layer)

Current Sprint: Supabase-native backend (ADR-0014)

Current Module: Identity And Access

Current Task: Phase 2 (Database Foundation) is COMPLETE — migrations 1-20 (SPEC-022 through SPEC-053): 71 tables, 65 catalog types / 395 catalog values, 76 RLS policies, append-only audit, and an executable verification smoke-test (scripts/verify_database.sql). The Database Naming Audit ran (schema found consistent; only status-column naming deferred to backend-phase start — logged in future-backlog). The backend architecture is decided (ADR-0014, SPEC-054): Supabase-native-first — PostgREST + RLS + PostgreSQL RPC backbone, Edge Functions + pg_cron/pg_net + n8n for out-of-DB compute, SSR web + shared Supabase surface for all clients, no standalone backend service unless a capability earns it. Now executing Phase 3 (Identity And Access) capability-by-capability under the CR lifecycle on that architecture. The deferred Architecture Knowledge Layer evaluation remains owner-scheduled for the stable post-database state (do not run yet). Deferred backlog items remain in reports/future-backlog.md (business-key uniqueness; finance non-negative CHECKs; status-column naming; authenticated DML grants — now being addressed as the Phase 3 first slice; subscription-state gating).

Last Completed Task: SPEC-056 — seeded the two flat global RBAC catalogs from 25_catalog_registry.md: roles (9 role_codes) and permissions (64 permission_keys), all system + active, idempotent on natural keys. role_permissions is intentionally left empty: how the scope-aware / conditional / plan-gated permission matrix (28) realizes onto the binary role_permissions table + enforcement is a separate owner-level architectural decision (pending). (Prior SPEC-055 granted authenticated DML + app.my_memberships() RPC.)

Next Planned Task: Owner-level architectural decision (pending presentation) — how the scope-aware / conditional / plan-gated permission matrix (28) realizes onto role_permissions + an enforcement/resolution function + RLS scope, before any role_permissions seeding or has_permission() is built. Then continue Phase 3 (Identity & Access) capability-by-capability — tenant/user/role/branch/department management RPCs, invitation/activation flow, TOTP-required enforcement for high-risk roles, device-trust baseline. Each its own CR. app.set_active_tenant() and multi-membership active-tenant persistence remain deferred (MVP degrades to single membership; ADR-0011).

Active Change Request: None

# Governance and Ownership

This document owns only the state above. Every other responsibility belongs elsewhere, by design, and is not restated here:

- Project identity, vision, and platform boundaries — `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`.
- Engineering principles, execution rules, and workflow — `AGENTS.md` and `PROTOCOL.md`.
- Document discovery and reading order — `README.md`'s First Reading Order.
- Phase and module progress — `_ORVION_CANONICAL/32_execution_roadmap.md`, the single source of truth for that state.

End of Document.
