# Permissions Matrix

Version: 0.2
Status: Draft
Canonical: Yes

---

# Purpose

This document defines ORVION's first permission model before database schema design.

Permissions must support all company departments while keeping tenant, branch, department, assignment, and subscription boundaries clear.

---

# Permission Principles

- Tenant isolation is mandatory.
- Role alone is not enough.
- Permission checks must consider scope.
- Subscription plan can disable features even if a user has role permission.
- Sensitive operations require explicit permission.
- Every permission change creates a security event.
- Every sensitive permission use creates an event.

---

# Scope Types

## tenant

Applies across the whole company tenant.

## branch

Applies only inside one branch.

## department

Applies only inside one department in one branch.

## assigned

Applies only to records assigned to the user.

## platform

Applies to ORVION platform administration, not tenant operations.

---

# Role Model

## owner

Tenant-level owner.

Can manage company-level settings and high-authority actions.

## ceo

Can view and manage company operations across branches according to permissions.

## branch_manager

Branch-level manager.

## department_manager

## employee

## trainee

Can view or perform limited actions only.

## system_administrator

# Booking Permissions

| Permission | Owner | CEO | Branch Manager | Department Manager | Finance Manager | Senior Employee | Employee | Trainee | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CREATE_BOOKING | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | Yes | Assigned only | No | branch/department |
| CREATE_BOOKING_ITEM | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | Yes | Assigned only | No | branch/department |
| APPROVE_BOOKING | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | No | No | branch/department |
| ISSUE_BOOKING | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | Yes | No | No | No | branch/department |
| UPDATE_BOOKING_ITEM_STATUS | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | Yes | Assigned only | No | assigned/department |
| ASSIGN_SUPPLIER | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Optional | Yes | Optional | No | branch/department |
| ENTER_SELLING_PRICE | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Optional | Yes | Assigned only | No | assigned |
| ENTER_COST | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Optional | Yes | Assigned only | No | assigned |
| ALLOW_ISSUE_WITH_NEGATIVE_BALANCE | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | Yes | No | No | No | branch/tenant |

Notes:

- Issuing before full collection requires explicit permission and creates risk flag event.
- Department Manager does not receive negative balance issuance permission by default.
- Booking lifecycle authority is capability-driven (ADR-0020): APPROVE_BOOKING governs the booking-level management approval `pending_approval -> confirmed` ("Required approval granted", 26) and is a management act, distinct from the item-level finance execution approval (APPROVE_FINANCE). ISSUE_BOOKING governs `in_progress -> issued` (issuance) and is finance-consequential (owner/ceo/branch_manager/finance_manager); issuing before full collection additionally requires ALLOW_ISSUE_WITH_NEGATIVE_BALANCE and emits the `booking_item_risk_flag_created` risk event capturing the customer balance snapshot. The remaining capability permissions (Cancel/Refund/Reissue) are minted by the CRs that first consume those transitions, per Earn-It / ADR-0015.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| APPROVE_FINANCE | Yes | Yes | Yes | Optional | No | No | No | tenant/branch |
| EDIT_LOCKED_COST | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | No | No | tenant |
| SET_EXCHANGE_RATE | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | No | No | tenant |
| CREATE_EXCHANGE_RATE_ADJUSTMENT | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | No | No | tenant |

| RECORD_PAYMENT | Yes | Yes | Yes | Optional | No | No | No | tenant |
| RECORD_REFUND | Yes | Yes | Yes | Optional | No | No | No | tenant |
| CREATE_JOURNAL_ENTRY | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | No | No | tenant |
| REVIEW_APPROVAL_REQUEST | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | No | No | tenant |

Notes:

- Assigned employee may view financial documents directly related to their lead/booking.
- Finance approval is required before controlled execution gate.
- Operations cannot edit locked cost.
- REVIEW_APPROVAL_REQUEST governs `approval_requests` rows whose `approval_type_code` is not `finance_execution_approval` (covered by APPROVE_FINANCE) and not `subscription_approval` (covered by REVIEW_SUBSCRIPTION_PAYMENT) — i.e. `refund_approval`, `discount_approval`, `booking_override`, `manual_price_change`, `sensitive_data_change`. This is a conservative default; per-type role refinement is an open business decision (see `reports/phase-02-prioritized-findings.md`).
