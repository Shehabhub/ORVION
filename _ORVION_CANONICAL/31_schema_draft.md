# Schema Draft

Version: 0.5
Status: Frozen Baseline
Canonical: Yes

---

# Purpose

This document defines the first logical ORVION database schema draft.

It is not a SQL migration.

It is the reviewable schema specification before writing SQL.

---

# Schema Scope

This draft covers:

- Organization and SaaS isolation
- Users, roles, permissions
- CRM leads and customers
- Tasks, quotations, notes, and conversations
- Booking and booking items
- Passengers
- Suppliers
- Finance core
- Documents
- Events and notifications
- Subscriptions and plan limits
- Authentication support
- Offline conversion engine

This draft intentionally excludes:

- Full tax engine
- Advanced financial statements
- GDS integrations
- Data warehouse
- Marketplace/plugin architecture
- Full workflow engine runtime
- HR/payroll

---

# Global Conventions

All tenant-owned tables include:

- id
- tenant_id
- created_at
- updated_at

Important business tables include archive fields:

- is_archived
- archived_at
- archived_by
- archive_reason

Events are immutable and never archived as normal business action.

Operational ownership fields should be applied consistently to work records:

- owner_user_id
- owner_department_id
- owner_branch_id

These fields represent current operational responsibility, not historical assignment. Historical movement is recorded through assignment tables and events.

---

# 1. System Catalog Tables

## catalog_types

Purpose:

Defines catalog groups.

Core fields:

- id
- code
- name
- ownership_type
- description
- is_active

## catalog_values

Purpose:

Stores system and tenant-controlled catalog values.

Core fields:

- id
- tenant_id nullable for system values
- catalog_type_code
- code
- label
- description
- sort_order
- is_active
- is_system
- created_by
- created_at
- updated_at

Notes:

- System catalog values have `tenant_id = null`.
- Tenant catalog values have tenant_id.

---

# 2. Organization Tables

## tenants

Purpose:

Represents subscribed travel companies.

Core fields:

- id
- name
- slug
- legal_name
- primary_phone
- primary_email
- default_currency_code
- status
- created_at
- updated_at

Unique:

- slug

## branches

Purpose:

Operational branches inside tenant.

Core fields:

- id
- tenant_id
- name
- slug
- branch_type optional
- primary_phone
- address

- created_at
- updated_at

Unique:

- tenant_id + slug

## departments

Purpose:

Departments inside branches.

Core fields:

- id
- tenant_id
- branch_id
- department_type_code
- name
- is_active
- created_at
- updated_at

## branch_business_hours

Purpose:

Defines weekly branch operating hours.

Core fields:

- id
- tenant_id
- branch_id
- day_of_week
- opens_at nullable
- closes_at nullable
- is_closed boolean

## holidays

Purpose:

Lightweight holiday calendar for SLA and operational planning.

Core fields:

- id
- tenant_id
- branch_id nullable
- name
- holiday_date
- is_recurring boolean
- description nullable

## users

Purpose:

Application users/employees.

Core fields:

- id
- tenant_id
- full_name
- phone
- email
- is_active
- is_platform_user
- created_at
- updated_at

Notes:

- This table has a mandatory one-to-one relationship with `auth.users`. Supabase Auth is the authentication identity; this table is ORVION's business profile layer. Authorization remains entirely inside ORVION RBAC — the JWT is authentication-only, never the authoritative source of business permissions. The physical key strategy is defined in `30_database_conventions.md`'s Identity Key Standard. See `# 13. Review Required` item 3.

## user_branch_assignments

Purpose:

Tracks current and historical branch assignments.

Core fields:

- id
- tenant_id
- user_id
- branch_id
- department_id nullable
- transfer_type_code
- starts_at
- ends_at
- is_primary
- reason
- created_by
- created_at

## roles

Purpose:

Defines roles.

Core fields:

- id
- code
- name
- description
- is_system
- is_active

## user_role_assignments

Purpose:

Assigns scoped roles to users.

---

# 2a. Reference Tables

## currencies

Purpose:

Canonical, validated currency list used by every `currency_code` column in this schema.

Core fields:

- code
- name
- symbol nullable
- decimal_places
- is_active
- created_at
- updated_at

Unique:

- code

Notes:

- Every `currency_code` column elsewhere in this document is a reference to `currencies.code`.
- `decimal_places` exists because the Money Standard's `numeric(14, 2)` convention (see `30_database_conventions.md`) is a safe default for EGP/SAR/USD but is not universal; this column allows a future currency to be onboarded without a silent rounding defect.

---

- merged_by
- reason nullable
- created_at

Notes:

- This table supplements, and does not replace, the customer_identity_merged event already defined in event_catalog.md. The event remains the audit-trail record of the action; this table is the queryable relational record.

- cost_locked_at nullable
- issued_at nullable
- completed_at nullable
- created_by
- created_at
- updated_at
- is_archived
- archived_at
- archived_by
- archive_reason

Notes:

- Booking items may be cancelled or marked no-show independently of parent booking state.
- Operational ownership changes should be recorded as events; a separate ownership history table is not required in this draft.
- `commission_rate` reserves a lightweight path for future sales commission calculation without creating a payroll model.

Rules:

- cost_amount and selling_amount must not be negative.

Core fields:

- id
- tenant_id
- booking_item_id

Unique:

- booking_item_id + passenger_id

Rules:

Core fields:

- id
- tenant_id
- journal_entry_id
- chart_account_id
- debit_amount numeric
- credit_amount numeric
- currency_code

- tenant_id
- payment_id
- invoice_id
- allocated_amount numeric
- currency_code
- exchange_rate_id nullable
- allocated_amount_invoice_currency numeric nullable
- created_by
- created_at

Notes:

- One payment may be allocated across multiple invoices; one invoice may receive allocations from multiple payments.
- sum(allocated_amount_invoice_currency) (or allocated_amount when no currency conversion applies) across all allocations for one invoice must not exceed that invoice's total_amount. This is an application/SQL-level rule, not a new table constraint description.
- invoice_status_code values partially_paid and paid are derived from the sum of this table's allocated amounts for the invoice, compared against invoices.total_amount.
- currency_code records the currency the payment was actually made in (matching payments.currency_code).
- exchange_rate_id (referencing exchange_rates) and allocated_amount_invoice_currency are populated only when the payment's currency differs from the invoice's currency, following the same pattern already established by booking_items.exchange_rate_id. When the payment and invoice share the same currency, both fields remain null and allocated_amount alone is authoritative.

Core fields:

- id
- tenant_id

Supported first-version approval types:

- finance_execution_approval

- subscription_approval

Notes:

- Booking items may still store `finance_approval_status_code` as a workflow summary.
- The approval record remains the source of review history.
- Finance execution approval uses `approval_type_code = finance_execution_approval`.
- Do not create a separate `finance_approvals` physical table unless implementation review proves it necessary.

# 12. Future Extension Notes

## event_links

Do not implement now.

Potential future purpose:

Support events that involve multiple business entities with stronger querying than a single `entity_type` and `entity_id`.

Example future use cases:

- Payment received for booking and customer.
- Document uploaded for passenger and booking item.
- Refund approved for payment, booking, and supplier.

Current decision:

Keep `events` as-is for MVP.

Add `event_links` only if implementation shows real timeline/reporting limitations.

---

# 13. Review Required

The following decisions are acceptable for MVP but should be reviewed before SQL migration:

1. `events` uses polymorphic entity fields. This is practical for timeline/audit.
2. `catalog_values` combines system and tenant values. This is simple, but requires careful constraints.
3. RESOLVED: `users` has a mandatory one-to-one relationship with `auth.users`. Supabase Auth is the authentication identity; `users` is ORVION's business profile layer. Authorization remains entirely inside ORVION RBAC (`roles`, `permissions`, `role_permissions`, `user_role_assignments`) — the JWT issued by Supabase Auth is authentication-only and is never the authoritative source of business permissions. RLS resolves authorization through `auth.uid()` and a `SECURITY DEFINER` lookup function against the current ORVION RBAC tables, not through JWT claims. The physical key strategy implementing this relationship is a project-wide convention, defined in `30_database_conventions.md`'s Identity Key Standard, and is not part of this architectural statement. This decision applies to future SQL migrations, RLS implementation, and authorization logic unless a future approved Change Request explicitly supersedes it.
4. Finance is journal-based, but advanced statements are deferred.
5. `approval_requests` is now generic. Finance execution approval should use this table instead of a separate physical finance approvals table.
6. `document_links` now uses explicit nullable target FKs instead of polymorphic target fields. SQL migration should enforce exactly one target per row.
7. Logical schema is frozen as the working baseline after this review. No additional schema redesign should happen unless implementation reveals a real problem.
8. Version 0.4 closed the Phase 1 Domain & Schema Audit findings via SPEC-002 and SPEC-003 (see changes/): added `currencies`, `payment_allocations`, and `customer_identity_merges`; added missing columns to `journal_entry_lines`, `invoices`, `booking_item_passengers`, `bookings`, `conversations`, `attribution_clicks`, `offline_conversions`, and `document_links`; documented five previously-unenforced constraints as table-level Rules (journal debit/credit exclusivity, booking_items and booking_item_passengers non-negative amounts, document_links single-target, document_versions single-current-version); and corrected the Table Classification Summary. State machines, events, and permissions for the CRM-extension entities (Task, Quotation, Conversation, Complaint, Service Request, Marketing Campaign) remain open and are explicitly deferred to the Phase 2 Catalog & Lifecycle Audit — no changes to `26_state_machines.md`, `27_event_catalog.md`, or `28_permissions_matrix.md` have been made as of this entry.

# Next Step

Create SQL migration plan.
